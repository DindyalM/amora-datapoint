# amora-datapoint

so we did a heroku app... aws next!!!!

anyways this datapoint returns json which will be used in SVELTE front end and we will add SHEIN next and maybe a few other brands 

currently when multiple devices connect it returns null at random times: 
  this could be due to the fact that its one server scraping from another website (FASHIONNOVA.com ETC)
  working this fix but it might not be needed as this is just another json data point
  
  
  check it out
